# TO DISCARD
tbl.activity <- mutate(tbl.activity, date = ymd(date), wd = as.character(wday(date, label = TRUE)), weekday.type = ifelse (between(wday(date), 2,6), "weekday", "weekend"))



## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

df.activity <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
tbl.activity <- tbl_df(df.activity)
rm("df.activity")
tbl.activity <- tbl.activity %>%
        mutate(date = ymd(date), weekday.type.char = ifelse (between(wday(date), 2,6), "weekday", "weekend")) %>%
        transform(weekday.type = factor(weekday.type.char))

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
